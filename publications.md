I defended my Ph.d. the 4th of december 2024 under the advising of San Vũ Ngọc, Nicolas Raymond and Yannick Guedes-Bonthonneau. I spent a lot of time working on the contributions of Johannes Sjöstrand in analytic microlocal analysis. I have very much enjoyed the reading of Michael Hitrik's work recently. 

Bohr Sommerfeld Expansions for a Class of Nonselfadjoint Operators *In preparation, with San Vũ Ngọc*
