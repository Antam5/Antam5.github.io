I defended my Ph.d. the 4th of december 2024 under the advising of San Vũ Ngọc, Nicolas Raymond and Yannick Guedes-Bonthonneau. I spent a lot of time working on the contributions of Johannes Sjöstrand in analytic microlocal analysis. I have very much enjoyed the reading of Michael Hitrik's work recently. 

***Here is a list of publications***

Bohr Sommerfeld Expansions for a Class of Nonselfadjoint Operators 2025 *In preparation, with San Vũ Ngọc*.

[Analytic Microlocal Bohr Sommerfeld Expansions 2024](https://github.com/Antam5/files/blob/main/Bohr%20Sommerfeld%20Analytic.pdf) 
*Submitted to Journal of Spectral Theory*.

[An example of Accurate Microlocal Tunneling 2025](https://github.com/Antam5/files/blob/main/Example%20of%20Microlocal%20Tunneling.pdf) with Nicolas Raymond, *To appear in Mathematical Research Letters*.
