I defended my Ph.d. the 4th of december 2024 under the advising of San Vu Ngoc, Nicolas Raymond and Yannick Guedes-Bonthonneau. I spent a lot of time working on the contributions of Johannes Sjöstrand in analytic microlocal analysis. I have very much enjoyed the reading of Michael Hitrik's work recently.
